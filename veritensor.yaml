# 🛡️ Veritensor Configuration File
# This file controls security policies and scanner behavior.

# --- General Settings ---

# Minimum severity level to fail the build (Exit Code 1).
# Options: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
# Default: CRITICAL (Blocks Remote Code Execution and Malware)
fail_on_severity: "CRITICAL"

# Output format for logs.
# Options: table (for humans), json (for scripts), sarif (for GitHub Security)
output_format: "table"

# --- Security Policies (Pickle/PyTorch) ---

# List of additional Python modules that are trusted during deserialization.
# Veritensor already trusts standard ML libraries (torch, numpy, collections).
# Add your internal company libraries or extra data science libs here.
allowed_modules:
  - "pandas"
  - "scipy"
  - "sklearn"
  - "tqdm"
  # - "my_company.internal_layer"

# --- Exceptions (False Positives) ---

# Specific threats to ignore. Use with caution!
# Format matches the output string: "SEVERITY: module.function"
ignored_rules:
  # Example: Allow checking if a file exists (usually safe)
  # - "CRITICAL: os.path.exists"
  
  # Example: Allow network requests (High risk, enable only if necessary)
  # - "HIGH: requests.get"

# --- Registry & Identity ---

# Hugging Face Token can be set here, but it is RECOMMENDED 
# to use the environment variable VERITENSOR_HF_TOKEN instead for security.
# hf_token: "hf_..."
